2\. Take a screenshot from a PC

#### **Take a screenshot from a Macbook**

There are two options to take a screenshot from a Macbook:

* 1\) To capture the entire screen, press **Command + Shift + 3**. The screenshot will be automatically saved as a PNG file on your desktop.
* 2\) To capture a portion of the screen, press **Command + Shift + 4**. A cross-hair cursor will appear, and you can click and drag to select the area you wish to capture. When you release the mouse button, the screenshot will be automatically saved as a PNG file on your desktop.

#### **Take a screenshot from a PC**

Depending on your hardware, you may use the **Windows Logo Key + PrtScn** button as a shortcut for the print screen. If your device does not have the PrtScn button, you may use **Fn + Windows logo key + Space Bar** to take a screenshot, which can then be printed. To locate your screenshots, open File Explorer from the taskbar. On the side navigation pane, select the Pictures folder, and select Screenshots.
