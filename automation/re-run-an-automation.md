# Re-run an automation

Re-running automation can be an effective method for recovering documents that were unable to be processed, or you need to remake.

**In this article, you will learn how to:**

1. **Re-run an automation that has previously been processed**
2. **Resending signature requests**

#### **Re-run an automation that has previously been processed**

To rerun an automation item, the first thing you need to do is to open your output page:

Next, you'll see a list of all the items that have been created by your workflow. On the right-hand side, you'll notice an icon featuring three dots. Give it a click, and then select "Rerun."

This will retake the data from the source and run it through the current document, which makes a new document (and sends emails/signature requests if they are part of your workflow).

#### **Resending signature requests**

Sometimes you don’t need to recreate the document, you just need to remind someone that they have a signature request. To resend a signature request, open the output page and expand the item line. Here you will see a button that will resend the signature request.&#x20;

> **Note:** Signature requests will expire after 30 days.
