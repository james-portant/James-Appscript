# Add multiple line items into a single document

Did you know you can add multiple connected object records into one document? For example, if you add multiple line items to a HubSpot deal, you can put them all in the same document within a table. Let's explore this together!

**In this article you will learn how to:**\
1\. Group multiple line items into a single file (works with all connected objects)

#### Group multiple line items into a single file

In this guide article we will jump straight to grouping multiple line items into a document. However, if this is your first time creating a workflow using HubSpot as a source, please refer to this [article](https://docs.portant.co/portant-docs/sources/hubspot#select-hubspot-as-your-workflow-source).

Once you have set up your workflow, open your template block (Google Docs or Slides):\

To add multiple objects into a document, the object tags need to be placed in a table. Then Portant will extend the table and add all the objects to the table, like this:

Then, ensure to insert all tags within a table. For instance, in this scenario, we're employing a table with tags for Line Item Name, Line Item Unit Price, and Line Item Quantity.

When running your workflow from a deal with multiple tags, Portant App seamlessly consolidates them into the same document by generating additional lines within the existing table.\
