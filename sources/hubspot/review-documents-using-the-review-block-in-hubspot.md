**How to review documents using the Review Block in HubSpot**

In this article, we will jump straight to reviewing documents in HubSpot. However, if this is the first time you are creating a Review Block in Portant App, please, refer to this [article](https://docs.portant.co/portant-docs/automation/review-block#how-to-add-a-review-block).

When a workflow with a HubSpot Source has a review block, each time the workflow runs, the documents will be held at the Review block stage. You will be able to see this in the HubSpot here:

**Note:** When the document is in the Review stage the status is "Draft". This status is also stored as a HubSpot Custom Property created by Portant.



To review the document, click the link within the CRM card, which will open the document in Google Docs or Slides. Then when you have reviewed it and made any changes, you can close the Google Doc/Slides window and click Actions > Approve like this:

When you click approve, the document will move to the next stage of the process and be captured as approved in the Portant Output page, the document status, and the Activities section on the HubSpot deal page.
