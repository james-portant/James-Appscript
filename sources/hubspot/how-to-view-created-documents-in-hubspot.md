# How to view created documents in HubSpot

Sometimes, you may require more precise tracking of the number of documents created within a specific HubSpot automation. The good news is, there are several ways to achieve this. Let's explore all options!! ðŸ™Œ\
\
In this article you will learn how to:

1. View created documents in the CRM Card
2. View created documents in the Activity Section
3. View created documents in the custom Properties
4. View created documents in the Attachments Section



**View created documents in the CRM Card**

The CRM card on a deal provides a summary of key details and actions related to that deal, such as deal stage, amount, close date, and next steps. It helps users quickly assess and manage deal progress. Also, within your CRM card, you'll find a Portant Card for running workflows directly within your HubSpot account and viewing your created documents. This card will appear automatically in your CRM once you've installed the Portant App. The installation process is straightforward; refer to this [LINK](https://docs.portant.co/portant-docs/sources/hubspot) to learn more.

#### View created documents in the Activity Section

&#x20;

The Activity Feed on a deal shows a timeline of interactions related to that deal, including emails, calls, meetings, and notes. It helps track the progress and communication history for that specific deal.\


Open a deal and click the "Activities" tab:

Click "Filter Activity" and select "Portant | Google Docs & eSign" from the options:

#### View created documents in the custom Properties

HubSpot custom properties on a deal allow you to track and store additional information specific to your business or process, enhancing the deal's context and relevance. Portant stores document details on a group of custom properties we add to your deal/contact/company/ticket. You can view them here:

> **Note** | You can use these custom properties to [trigger HubSpot Workflows](trigger-hubspot-workflows-from-portant.md) or create dashboards or reports

You can also add these properties to the left hand menu here:
