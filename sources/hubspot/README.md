After you have signed up, click the blue button in the top right-hand corner: **New Workflow**.

#### Select HubSpot as your Workflow Source

The next step is to select HubSpot as the source for your workflow.&#x20;

#### Install the Portant HubSpot App and link your accounts

If this is the first time you have selected HubSpot as a Source, then you will be asked to install the [Portant App in HubSpot](https://ecosystem.hubspot.com/marketplace/apps/sales/sales-enablement/portant-hubspot-google-docs-integration), for more details please check out [this guide](how-to-install-the-portant-app-in-hubspot/)

This will allow Portant to source data from HubSpot to customise your documents.

#### Format and customise your document template

When you have successfully connected Portant to HubSpot, your workflow will look like this:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/pika-1706757355265-1x.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The next step is to connect a document template. You can do this by clicking the 'plus' **(+)** button below the HubSpot block. \


<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/pika-1706757345259-1x.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Here you can select to connect a Google Doc, Slides, or even email template to be customised and generated from HubSpot data.

When you have picked your document template, you can customise it by placing HubSpot tags from the Source table into the document. To insert a tag, click **Copy** and then insert your cursor where you'd like the tag to be placed and hit **CTRL + V** or **CMD(âŒ˜) + V**

<figure><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f3b57b5405f8bd0f98b5e14/63d3b6cae72c801111453244_HubSpot%20Screenshot%201%20%E2%80%93%209.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

You can also customise the file name in the right panel and select if you'd like the document to be saved as a PDF.

> **Note:** All PDFs in the Free tier have a Portant watermark in the footer. To remove the watermark, please upgrade to our [Teams or Pro plans](https://app.portant.co/settings/billing)

#### Select your HubSpot Primary Object

When you open the Source page, there is a Dropdown in the top right corner where you can select the Primary Object your workflow will run from, here:

<figure><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f3b57b5405f8bd0f98b5e14/647091aea1ed9ddfeb55aeba_HubSpot%20Workflow%20%E2%80%93%202.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This also determines where you will be able to access your workflow. e.g. If you select Deals as your Primary Object, then you will be able to access the workflow in your Deal CRM Cards. Please note, that other fields connected to your Primary Object will be able to be included in your documents. e.g. If you choose Deal as your primary Object, you will be able to access the Company, Contact, and Line item data connected to that deal.

#### Manage your HubSpot Fields

HubSpot has hundreds of fields that you can include in your document workflow(not to mention your own Custom Properties). Portant has a way to manage which fields to include in your workflow on the source page. Click **Manage HubSpot Fields** here:

<figure><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f3b57b5405f8bd0f98b5e14/650837561a979f6b233a178a_HubSpot%20Workflow%20%E2%80%93%203.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This will open a modal where you can select which HubSpot Fields will be included in your Source Table (and which you can insert in your documents)

<figure><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f3b57b5405f8bd0f98b5e14/647093bb0d72f61b1a8c9eb9_HubSpot%20Workflow%20%E2%80%93%204.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After you have selected which fields you'd like to include you can click **Save,** and they will be added to the source table.

#### Generate your first document

After you have customised the template and are happy with the formatting, it's time to generate your first document.

To generate a document, navigate back to HubSpot and open a deal.

**Open HubSpot > Open a Deal**

Then Portant will appear in the right panel, here:

<figure><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f3b57b5405f8bd0f98b5e14/63d3b74c2146476b67102812_HubSpot%20Screenshot%201.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

To generate a document. Click Actions and then click your workflow name

<figure><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f3b57b5405f8bd0f98b5e14/63d3b77e860711384fe4c47f_HubSpot%20Screenshot%201%20%E2%80%93%201.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

> **Note** - If you workflow doesn't appear in the list make sure you are looking at the right Primary object in HubSpot. Portant workflows will only appear on the [Primary Object page selected in the source in Portant](./#select-your-hubspot-primary-object)

After you select the Workflow name a modal will appear where you can start the automation. In this modal you can select the associated objects to be included in the document. For example, if you have multiple contacts you can select the contact to use in the document:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/pika-1709102741767-1x.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This will start the document generation process. It will take a few seconds to generate the document. Please refresh your page, and you will see the document link appear in the side bar above the action button. The same document will also be saved in a new folder created in your google drive.

That's all there is to it, you've just set up a document workflow using a HubSpot as a data source.
