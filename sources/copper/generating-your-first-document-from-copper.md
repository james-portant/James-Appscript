# Generating your first document from Copper

**Running the Workflow**

When you "**Start**" the workflow the data from the opportunity (and connected objects) will be used to create a new output document and the document links will be added to the activity feed and the files section.

**Viewing the Output**

* On the right side of your screen in Copper, locate the "Files" section. Click the dropdown button to view the attached output.
