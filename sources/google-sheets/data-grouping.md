# Data Grouping

Portant Workflow can group data within your source spreadsheet and place it into tables within your document. If your source spreadsheet contains multiple rows that should be grouped and inserted into one table then this is the feature for you. A good example use case is when you need to include multiple Google Sheet rows into an[ _invoice_ template](https://www.portant.co/google-sheets-invoice-template) or _purchase order._

If you need to use this feature, your source spreadsheet will normally have rows that are grouped together like the example below.

You can easily place a data merge table into a document in a few easy steps:

**Step 1**

Open the Google Sheet Source Block, then open the source field details by clicking the row in the source table. You can then select the data grouping option. This column needs to be unique (e.g. no columns which are named _Invoice Number_ and _Invoice No._ with the same data in the column.

**Step 2**

Add or open the document block and insert a table into the document (Insert > Table).

Then add the tags to the table. These are the tags of the data that will have multiple lines per document. Please ensure the tags are only added to one row.

> **Note:** You can also apply data grouping when using Google Slides as a template within your workflows.

> **Optional:** You can add header and footer rows to the top and bottom rows of the table and format as appropriate. The additional rows will only be placed immediately after the row with tags.

**Step 3**

After you have set up the grouping and other document settings (e.g. Document name, pdf or email, etc) you can click the Create Documents button, and _voila!_ invoices will be made, including tables with multiple lines from the spreadsheet source!\
