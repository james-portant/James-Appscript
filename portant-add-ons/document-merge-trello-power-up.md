* **\{{Board Name\}}** - This is the name of the board the card is on

* **\{{Members\}}** - This adds the members of the card
* **\{{Labels\}}** - This adds the labels of the card
* **\{{Card URL\}}** - This is the url to the card

If you have custom fields on your board you can also use them by simply including the name of the custom field in a pair of two curly brackets just like the other tags.

Custom fields is now a paid feature included in their Standard and Premium tiers
