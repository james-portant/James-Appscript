# Edit Response and Pre-filled Response Links

The edit response and the pre-filled response links are great ways for Google Form respondents to save time when submitting multiple form responses or if you would like to use Google Forms for an approval workflow.

**In this article you’ll learn how to:**

1. Where the Edit and Pre-filled response links are found
2. Use the Edit Response Link
3. Use the Pre-filled Response Link

#### Where are the Edit and Pre-filled response links found?

To add an Edit or a Pre-filled link to a workflow you need to open up the Email settings by clicking the **'Automatically email created docs'** checkbox within the **'Share via email'** box. After the **'Email Settings'** modal opens you can see the Form Response Links on the right side under template tags.

#### Using the Edit Response link

The 'Edit Response' link allows a user to edit the answers they submitted to a Google Form. When a user clicks on this type of link the Google Form will open with all the answers they originally submitted entered into the questions. The user can then change any of the answers by making a new selection or editing the information entered. When the user clicks 'Submit' **the original line/information is updated** in the responses Spreadsheet with the new information.

> **Note** - this will edit the original response row in your Responses Spreadsheet, it will **not** create a new row.

When questions have been resubmitted the edited answers will be marked with a triangle in the top right hand corner like this:

Portant will then recreate the document and save it in the output folder (the original document will also remain in this folder). If the '**Document Links in Spreadsheet'** option has been selected the links in the response spreadsheet will also be updated.

Additionally you can see what the original answers were by right clicking on the cell and selecting **'Show edit history'**. This will show the previous answer.

#### Using the Pre-filled response link

The 'Pre-filled' response link allows a user to add another response to a form with answers pre-filled. When a user clicks on this link the Google Form will open with all the answers they originally submitted entered into the questions. The user can then change any of the answers by making a new selection or editing the information entered. When the user clicks 'Submit' **a new line is entered** at the bottom of the responses Spreadsheet with the new information.

Portant will then create another document with the new information and save it in the output folder.
