# How to set-up a Google Sheets source

This article will show you how to set up Google Sheets as a source for Portant Data Merge. Google Sheets is the perfect source if you already have a data set you would like to create documents from.

**In this article youâ€™ll learn how to:**

1. Select an existing Google Sheets file
2. Create a new Google Sheets file

#### Connect to an existing Google Sheets file

After you have selected to connect a Google Sheets source from the 'Home Page' you will need to set it up. Click the **Choose File** button to open the file picker window. This is where you can search for and select the Google Sheet you would like to connect. After you have found and selected the correct file, click **Select**.&#x20;

If you selected a Spreadsheet with multiple sheets, you will need to select the sheet that contains the data from the dropdown list before clicking **Continue.**

> Note - Portant can only source data from one sheet per document.

> **Top Tip** - After you have selected the file, you can click the file name to open it in a new tab. Great for checking if everything is as you expect.

> **Note** - For sheets, Portant requires the column headers to be in the first row of the spreadsheet.

#### Create a new Google Sheets file

If you do not have a Google Sheets file with data in yet, you can use the 'Create new' button. After you click this button, a new Google Sheets file is created with your filename and connected to your template. This Google Sheets file has some sample data in it that you can use to test with.
