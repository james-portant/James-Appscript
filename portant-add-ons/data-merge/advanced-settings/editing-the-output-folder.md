# Editing the Output Folder

Sometimes you might want to be change the folder the output documents are being saved in when using Portant. This article will show you how to change the folder to suit your needs. You can do this by either moving the folder or by changing the folder in the settings.

**In this article you’ll learn how to:**

1. Edit the folder
2. Move the folder
3. Change the folder

#### How to edit the folder

When you first create a merge, after connecting your 'source', Portant will create an output folder in the same location as your template file. You can open this folder by clicking 'Open' in the top right hand corner of the Document Outputs box. The folder name will be: '\*Template name\* \[Outputs]'.\

The name of this folder can be changed to suit your needs (Portant will always remember to save the created documents in this folder). To do this, click the 'Open' button and then click on the folder name at the top of the page and select '**Rename**' from the menu that drops down. Enter the new name and then click 'OK'
