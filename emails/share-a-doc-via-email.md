> **Note** - You can also send emails via Outlook. Read [this guide](send-outlook-emails.md) to learn more.

Once you have created a new email block you will see the options to add a To, CC or BCC address in the email block. In these fields you can type email addresses or use tags from the source table on the right hand side. Then below that you can also enter a subject line and a message. There are some formatting options that enable you to make the email look the way you want it to:
