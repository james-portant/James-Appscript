#### Customize an Output Title for Your Files

In this guide article we will jump straight to customizing the output name for your files. However, if this is your first time creating a Portant workflow, please refer to this [article](https://docs.portant.co/portant-docs/getting-started/quickstart).



Once you've created your workflow, open the Template Block:

Next, find the field labeled "Output Name" on the right side of your screen:\

Then, you can either enter text or insert a tag from your source table above the "Output Name" field. In this example, we're using the text “Client” along with the tags \{{Contact First Name\}} and \{{Contact Last Name\}}. This way, each generated document will have a title customized with the client’s name from the associated data.\
Click “Enter” to save the new output name:

Here’s an example of the result: "Client: Jerry Burke".\

You're all set! 🤩\
Now you can easily locate and organize your outputs more effectively.\
