The Portant Team plan has a few different roles that you can use to manage your team and keep your workflows running smoothly.

In this article you will learn

1. The different roles and what they do
2. How to change a team members role

### The different team roles and what they do

There are 5 different roles that can be present within a team. The first role, the team owner, is set by whomever purchased the Portant Teams plan. The other roles can be given to any team member that joins the Owners team.

> Please contact support to change the team owner.

Here is a list of what the different roles are able to do:

<table data-header-hidden data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th width="105">Role</th><th width="129" align="center">Manage Billing</th><th width="124" align="center">Manage Users</th><th width="152" align="center">Create Workflow</th><th width="112" align="center">Run Workflow</th><th align="center">View Workflow</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td></td><td align="center"><strong>Manage Billing</strong></td><td align="center"><strong>Manage Users</strong></td><td align="center"><strong>Create Workflow</strong></td><td align="center"><strong>Run Workflow</strong></td><td align="center"><strong>View Workflow</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Owner</strong></td><td align="center">✅</td><td align="center">✅</td><td align="center">✅</td><td align="center">✅</td><td align="center">✅</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Admin</strong></td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">✅</td><td align="center">✅</td><td align="center">✅</td><td align="center">✅</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Editor</strong></td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">✅</td><td align="center">✅</td><td align="center">✅</td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>User /</strong></p><p><strong>Runner</strong></p></td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">✅</td><td align="center">✅</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Viewer</strong></td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">-</td><td align="center">✅</td></tr></tbody></table>

Here is a list of the access grated to each user when they join a team

<table data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th width="240">App</th><th width="250">Owner + Admin + Editor</th><th width="292">User / Runner + Viewer</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Google Sheets + Forms</strong> [Source]</td><td>✏️ Edit Access</td><td>👀 View Access</td></tr><tr><td><strong>HubSpot, Copper, Tally, Glide, Excel</strong> [Source]</td><td>Not changed by Portant - Managed by app</td><td>Not changed by Portant - Managed by app</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Google Docs, Slides, Sheets and PDFs</strong> [Template]</td><td>✏️ Edit Access</td><td>👀 View Access</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gmail + Outlook</strong> [Email]</td><td>✏️ Edit Access</td><td>👀 View Access</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Google Drive Folder</strong></td><td>✏️ Edit Access</td><td>✏️ Edit Access</td></tr></tbody></table>

They can't edit anything within the workflow, but they can view outputs from the workflow. </td></tr><tr><td><strong>Viewer</strong></td><td>The viewer can view all the workflows and the outputs they have created.</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### **How to change a team members role**

When you add someone to your team, you will be able to select which role they join the team with. This defaults to 'Editor'.

To change the role of a team member please visit the [team management page](https://app.portant.co/settings/team).

In the Role column of the team members table you will be able to select and change each user's permissions, like this:
