# United States: E-SIGN Act and UETA ✅

**Is Portant compliant: Yes ✅**

The E-SIGN Act and UETA are foundational laws that regulate electronic signatures and records in the United States. They establish the legal equivalence of electronic and handwritten signatures, ensuring that electronic agreements are just as enforceable as those on paper. This article provides an overview of these laws, explains when they apply, and details Portant’s features that ensure compliance, giving you confidence in our eSignature solution.

**Overview of the E-SIGN Act and UETA**

* **E-SIGN Act** (Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act)
  * **Location:** United States (Federal Law)
  * **Applies to:** All states except those that have adopted UETA with minimal variations, which include Illinois and New York.
  * **Key Point:** The E-SIGN Act validates the legal standing of electronic signatures for commerce transactions.
* **UETA** (Uniform Electronic Transactions Act)
  * **Location:** Adopted in 47 U.S. states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
  * **Applies to:** Domestic transactions involving electronic records and signatures.
  * **Key Point:** UETA sets out a uniform approach to electronic transactions within each state.

**When and Where the Laws Apply**

The E-SIGN Act and UETA apply under the following conditions:

* **Type of Transactions**: They apply to contracts or transactions that would traditionally require a written agreement, such as sales, leases, employment agreements, and other business transactions.
* **Jurisdictions**: These laws are applicable in the United States, with UETA adopted by nearly all states. Note that specific state laws can sometimes add unique requirements.
* **Consent to Use Electronic Signatures**: Both laws mandate that all parties involved must agree to conduct transactions electronically.

**Practical Considerations When Using Electronic Signatures**

While Portant’s eSignatures are designed to comply with E-SIGN and UETA, there are several considerations for effective and compliant use:

1. **Confirming Consent**
   * Parties should clearly consent to receive and sign documents electronically. Portant’s interface includes clear consent prompts to help users comply with this requirement.
2. **Ensuring Document Security**
   * After a document is signed, it should not be modified. Portant’s Document Integrity Verification feature locks signed documents, ensuring they remain unaltered.
3. **Maintaining Evidence of the Transaction**
   * Audit logs, timestamps, and other transaction records can serve as crucial evidence in legal scenarios. Portant’s audit trail feature keeps detailed records of all actions in the signing process, which can be retrieved as needed.
4. **Understanding State-Specific Requirements**
   * Although the E-SIGN Act and UETA are widely accepted, some states may impose additional requirements. Users should verify if additional compliance considerations apply to their specific state.
5. **Using Appropriate Document Types**
   * While the E-SIGN Act and UETA generally apply to most contracts, there are some exceptions. Documents like wills, court orders, and certain family law documents often require physical signatures.
