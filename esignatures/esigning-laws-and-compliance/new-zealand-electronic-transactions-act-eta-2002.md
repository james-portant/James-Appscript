# New Zealand: Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) 2002 ✅

**Is Portant compliant: Yes ✅**

In New Zealand, electronic transactions are governed by the **Electronic Transactions Act 2002 (ETA)**, which ensures that electronic signatures and records hold the same legal standing as their paper counterparts. The Act facilitates electronic commerce and communication across New Zealand, enabling businesses and individuals to carry out legally binding transactions online. This article provides an overview of the ETA, explains its requirements, and highlights how Portant’s eSignature solution aligns with the standards set out by the Act.

**Overview of the Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) 2002**

The Electronic Transactions Act 2002 was enacted to support New Zealand’s growing digital economy by providing a legal framework for electronic signatures and records.

* **Location**: New Zealand
* **Purpose**: To ensure electronic signatures and records are legally equivalent to handwritten signatures and paper documents, provided they meet certain requirements.
* **Scope**: The ETA applies to most types of contracts, agreements, and transactions, including both business and personal exchanges. It applies to electronic records and signatures across all sectors, with certain document types excluded.

***

**When and Where the ETA Applies**

The ETA applies in a broad range of digital transactions in New Zealand, subject to the following conditions:

* **Type of Transactions**: The ETA covers commercial, personal, and governmental transactions where documents traditionally require a written signature, including contracts, acknowledgments, and approvals.
* **Jurisdictions**: Applies to New Zealand-wide transactions, enabling electronic records and signatures to be legally binding across the country.
* **Consent to Use Electronic Signatures**: The Act requires that all parties involved consent to conduct the transaction electronically and to use electronic signatures.

**Best Practices for Using eSignatures Under the ETA**

Portant’s eSignature solution provides essential features to ensure compliance with the ETA, but there are several considerations for effective and compliant use:

1. **Confirming Consent from All Parties**
   * Each party must agree to use electronic signatures for the transaction. Portant’s interface includes clear consent prompts to support this requirement, confirming each user’s intent to sign electronically.
2. **Ensuring Document Security and Integrity**
   * Documents must remain unaltered after signing to retain legal validity. Portant’s Document Integrity Verification feature locks signed documents, safeguarding their authenticity and ensuring compliance with ETA requirements.
3. **Keeping Comprehensive Audit Trails**
   * Audit logs provide a record of the signing process, supporting legal validity. Portant’s audit trail feature records each stage of the signing process, including timestamps, to maintain an evidentiary record for future reference.
4. **Understanding Document Exceptions**
   * While the ETA applies broadly, certain documents, such as wills, property transactions, and powers of attorney, may still require handwritten signatures. Users should verify if their document type falls under any exceptions to electronic signatures in New Zealand.
5. **Maintaining Compliance with Data Protection**
   * Personal data associated with electronic signatures must be handled securely. Portant complies with data protection standards, encrypting user data and securely storing signed documents.

**Compliance with Different Levels of Assurance**

The ETA does not categorize electronic signatures into levels as strictly as other international standards (e.g., the EU’s eIDAS Regulation). However, Portant’s solution provides assurance features similar to basic electronic signatures, with some functionality compatible with higher-assurance requirements if additional verification methods are needed.
