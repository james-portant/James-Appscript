# UK: eIDAS Regulation and Electronic Communications Act 2000 ✅

**Is Portant compliant: Yes ✅**

In the United Kingdom, electronic signatures and transactions are governed by the **eIDAS Regulation** (Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services) and the **Electronic Communications Act 2000**. These laws establish the legal validity and enforceability of electronic signatures, ensuring they are equivalent to handwritten signatures in most scenarios. This article provides an overview of the regulations, explains when they apply, and details Portant’s compliance features to help you securely and confidently use electronic signatures in the UK.

**Overview of the eIDAS Regulation and Electronic Communications Act 2000**

The eIDAS Regulation and Electronic Communications Act 2000 set the standard for electronic signatures and transactions in the UK, supporting their legality and providing a framework for secure electronic identification. Here’s a quick breakdown:

* **eIDAS Regulation** (EU Regulation No. 910/2014 on electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions)
  * **Location**: UK and European Union (adapted into UK law post-Brexit).
  * **Key Point**: Establishes three levels of electronic signatures (Simple, Advanced, and Qualified) to ensure legal recognition and security for electronic transactions.
* **Electronic Communications Act 2000**
  * **Location**: United Kingdom
  * **Key Point**: Recognizes electronic signatures as legally valid, provided there is intent to authenticate, supporting the enforceability of electronic agreements and transactions.

***

**When and Where the eIDAS Regulation and Electronic Communications Act Apply**

These regulations apply in a wide range of digital transactions in the UK. Key criteria include:

* **Type of Transactions**: The regulations cover most commercial, personal, and governmental transactions that would traditionally require written signatures, including contracts, agreements, and acknowledgments.
* **Jurisdictions**: eIDAS was retained in UK law post-Brexit and applies alongside the Electronic Communications Act to uphold electronic signature validity.
* **Consent to Use Electronic Signatures**: Both parties must consent to using electronic signatures for the transaction.

#### Compliance with eIDAS Signature Levels

Under the eIDAS Regulation, electronic signatures are categorized into three levels: **Simple Electronic Signature (SES)**, **Advanced Electronic Signature (AES)**, and **Qualified Electronic Signature (QES)**. Each level provides varying degrees of security and legal assurance. Portant’s eSignature solution primarily supports SES, which meets the needs of most business transactions, and includes some AES-compatible features. Here is a breakdown of Portant's compliance across these levels:

| Signature Level                          | Description                                                                                                                           | Portant’s Compliance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple Electronic Signature (SES)**    | Basic level, suitable for most business transactions.                                                                                 | **Compliant**: Portant provides SES functionality for everyday business transactions, including user consent, document integrity, and audit trails.                                                                                                       |
| **Advanced Electronic Signature (AES)**  | Higher security level, requiring strict identification and control criteria to uniquely identify the signer.                          | **Partial Compliance**: Portant supports some AES features (such as audit trails, integrity verification, and timestamping) but does not provide biometric verification or advanced signer identification, which may be required for full AES compliance. |
| **Qualified Electronic Signature (QES)** | Highest level, legally equivalent to handwritten signatures in court, requires a qualified certificate from a trust service provider. | **Not Compliant**: Portant currently does not provide QES, as it requires certificates from a qualified trust service provider under eIDAS.                                                                                                               |

**Note**: While Portant fully supports SES for most business transactions, AES or QES levels may be necessary for high-assurance transactions, particularly those requiring unique signer identification. Users needing full AES or QES compliance can consider adding external verification or a qualified trust provider for additional assurance.

By understanding these compliance levels, you can confidently use Portant’s eSignature solution for a range of business transactions in the UK.

**Practical Considerations for Using eSignatures in the UK**

While Portant’s eSignature solution is designed to meet eIDAS and the Electronic Communications Act standards, there are several considerations to ensure secure and compliant electronic transactions:

1. **Confirming User Consent**
   * All parties must agree to the use of electronic signatures. Portant’s user consent prompt ensures compliance by confirming each user’s intention to sign electronically.
2. **Ensuring Document Security**
   * Signed documents must be protected against tampering. Portant’s Document Integrity Verification feature locks the document after signing, preventing modifications and preserving authenticity.
3. **Keeping Comprehensive Audit Trails**
   * Detailed audit logs are essential for proving a document’s validity. Portant’s audit trail feature securely records each action in the signing process, including timestamps, to create a verifiable record.
4. **Choosing the Right Level of Signature**
   * The eIDAS Regulation outlines three levels of signatures:
     * **Simple Electronic Signature (SES)**: Basic level, suitable for most business transactions.
     * **Advanced Electronic Signature (AES)**: Provides a higher level of security, meeting strict identification and control criteria.
     * **Qualified Electronic Signature (QES)**: The highest level, legally equivalent to a handwritten signature in court and requires a qualified certificate from a trust service provider.
   * Portant’s eSignatures generally fall under SES but can support AES, depending on the security needs of the transaction. For high-assurance transactions, users may want to consider QES options.
5. **Understanding Document Exclusions**
   * Certain legal documents, like wills, deeds, and property transfers, may still require a handwritten signature. Users should verify if their document types fall under exceptions to electronic signatures.
