# Israel: Electronic Signature Law 2001

In Israel, the use of electronic signatures is governed by the **Electronic Signature Law 2001** and related regulations. This law ensures that electronic signatures are legally recognized and enforceable, provided they meet specific criteria. Additionally, compliance with Israel’s data protection laws, particularly the **Protection of Privacy Law 1981**, is essential when handling personal information in electronic transactions. This article provides an overview of these laws and details how Portant’s eSignature solution complies with them.

***

**Overview of Israel’s Electronic Signature Law**

Israel’s Electronic Signature Law 2001 establishes the legal framework for electronic signatures and their use in digital transactions. The law categorizes electronic signatures into three types based on their level of assurance:

1. **Basic Electronic Signature**: Any digital means of signing a document.
2. **Secure Electronic Signature**: A digital signature that ensures authenticity, integrity, and signer identification.
3. **Certified Electronic Signature**: A secure electronic signature backed by a certificate from a recognized certification authority.

***

**When and Where the Law Applies**

The Electronic Signature Law applies in various contexts across Israel, with specific conditions:

* **Type of Transactions**: Most commercial, governmental, and personal transactions where traditional written signatures are required, including contracts, agreements, and official forms.
* **Consent to Use Electronic Signatures**: All parties must agree to use electronic means for signing and transactions.
* **Exceptions**: Certain documents, such as wills, real estate transactions, and some legal agreements, may still require handwritten signatures.
