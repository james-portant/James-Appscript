---

# Australia: Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) ✅

**Is Portant compliant: Yes ✅**

The Australian Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) governs the use of electronic signatures in Australia, ensuring that electronic documents and signatures are legally equivalent to paper-based ones when specific criteria are met. This article explains when and where the ETA applies, who it affects, and highlights Portant's compliance features, giving you confidence that our eSignature solution meets the ETA requirements.

***

**Overview of the Electronic Transactions Act (ETA)**

The ETA was enacted to facilitate electronic commerce across Australia and to make electronic signatures legally binding. The Act applies at both the **federal level** (Electronic Transactions Act 1999) and **state/territory levels**, with each state adopting variations based on the federal model.

* **Location**: Australia-wide, with federal and state-specific adaptations.
* **Purpose**: To ensure electronic records and signatures are legally recognized in the same way as handwritten signatures and paper documents.

***

**When and Where the ETA Applies**

The ETA applies to a broad range of transactions, provided all parties consent to use electronic means. Below are key criteria for the ETA’s application:

* **Type of Transactions**: It applies to most business, commercial, and personal transactions where documents would traditionally require written signatures, including contracts, agreements, and acknowledgments.
* **Jurisdictions**: The federal ETA applies to Commonwealth government agencies, while each state and territory has an ETA governing its electronic transactions.
* **Consent to Use Electronic Signatures**: All parties must agree to conduct the transaction electronically, either explicitly or implicitly.

**Key Compliance Requirements and Portant’s Approach**

To comply with the ETA, Portant’s eSignature solution provides essential features to fulfill the Act’s primary requirements:

**Practical Considerations for Using eSignatures in Australia**

While Portant’s eSignatures are designed to comply with the ETA, there are several considerations to ensure the signatures are legally valid and enforceable:

1. **Obtaining User Consent**
   * All parties must agree to sign electronically. Portant’s user interface clearly prompts for consent, ensuring users meet this ETA requirement.
2. **Maintaining Document Security**
   * Signed documents should remain unaltered after the signing process. Portant’s Document Integrity Verification feature locks signed documents, protecting them from any post-signature modifications.
3. **Keeping Audit Trails for Record**
   * Audit logs provide a record of actions taken during the signing process. Portant’s audit trail feature securely logs each step, creating a verifiable record for future reference.
4. **Understanding State and Territory Variations**
   * The ETA is a federal law, but states and territories may have unique requirements. Users may need to review local adaptations of the ETA to ensure compliance, especially for highly regulated transactions.
5. **Determining Applicable Document Types**
   * While the ETA generally applies to most types of transactions, certain legal documents (like wills, powers of attorney, and documents requiring a notary) might still require handwritten signatures.
