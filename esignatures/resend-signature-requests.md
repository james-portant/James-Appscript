# Resend signature requests

Portant offers a fantastic feature that allows you to resend a signature request to a recipient. This is particularly helpful if the recipient forgot to sign a document, as you can quickly follow a few simple steps instead of rerunning the entire automation.

The first step is to open your output page:

Next, you'll see a list of all the items created by your workflow. Click on the dropdown button on the left side to view all outputs created by each automation.

Finally, click on "Resend." The resend button will only be visible for automations where the signable document has not yet been signed.
