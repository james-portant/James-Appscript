# Adding Images

Portant Workflow can add images to your template. All you have to do is identify a source row as an image and insert the placeholder image, and after that, you can edit the position and size of the image.

#### 1. Identify source row as an image

In the Source Table, open the drop-down, select to insert value as ‘image’, and then you can insert the placeholder image.

When you insert the placeholder image it is inserted at the end of your document. You can position this image wherever you want to inside the document or duplicate it if it needs to be inserted multiple times.

> **Note 1: O**nly publicly accessible urls that store images in .jpg, .jpeg, .png and .gif file formats are supported.

> **Note 2: New Feature:** if you are using Google Docs as a template, you may add multiple images to your template.

### 2b. Resize the image - Slides

You can resize the placeholder image to suit your presentation format like this:\

Inserted images are always placed into the presentation with a locked aspect ratio (Portant doesn't distort any images to fit the placeholder size). If an inserted image has a different ratio to the text box, Portant scales the image to the maximum size it can be within the bounds of the text box whilst maintaining the original image ratio.

### 2b. Resize the image - Docs

You can resize the placeholder image to suit your document format like this:

<figure><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5f3b57b5405f8bd0f98b5e14/62b5b497393fc5e14d3a109a_Portant%20Workflow%20-%20Resize%20image%20tag%20-%20Docs.gif" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Inserted images are placed into the document with a locked aspect ratio (Portant doesn't distort any images to fit the text box). If an inserted image has a different aspect ratio to the placeholder image, Portant scales and centers the image to fill the bounds of the placeholder image. **The image may be cropped in order to fill the placeholder image's bounds**. The rendered size of the image will be the same as that of the placeholder image.

Please note that in Google Docs, images can only be placed with the 'Move with text' option, as shown above. If you need to fix the position of an image of an image in a document, please use a Google Slides template (In Google Slides, it's possible to fix the position of an image).
