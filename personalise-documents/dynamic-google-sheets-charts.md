#### **How to add Google Sheets Charts to Google Docs and Google Slides**

In this article, we will jump straight to adding a Google Sheets chart to a Google Docs and a Google Slides template. However, if this is your first time creating a workflow, please refer to this [**article**](https://www.portant.co/guide-article/how-to-create-your-first-workflow) to learn more.&#x20;

The first step is to copy the chart from your Google Sheets Source:

Next, insert it into your template document by selecting the "Link to spreadsheet" option:

> Note | If you select the 'Paste unlinked' option, your chart will be inserted into your template as a static snapshot, preventing updates from being reflected within it.

And then your template will look like this:\

#### **How Google Sheets Charts in Google Slides work during an automation**

When an automation is run Portant will make sure all the charts are updated so they contain the most recent data. It‚Äôs a bit like clicking this update button before running an automation (apart from Portant does it automatically)

Then your outputs will contain the most recent and up to date charts.

#### **Feedback and feature suggestions**

We created Portant in 2021 and the feedback we have received since then has been very helpful and greatly appreciated. If you have any feedback please feel free to send us an email at contact@portant.co
